      // Definition:
        // If Statement is an operation in java, in which we provide either a true or false condition and
        // let java to make decision for us based on expression we provide to.
        // Also, it should be mentioned that in "If Statement", java will solely execute the true block of code.
        // For instance,

        char grade = 'A';
        if (grade != 'B') {
            System.out.println("Batch18 students are very intuitive!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("That is the previous Batch;)");
        }
    }
